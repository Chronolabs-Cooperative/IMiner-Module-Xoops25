# Image Mining XOOPS 2.5

## Version 1.xx (Still in Development)

### Author: Simon Roberts <simon@snails.email>

This module allows you to browse the module installed on your XOOPS site by classes and objectivity and then periodically check for posts that contain images that are held remotely to the site which it will import then watermark and put in storage, as well as provisioning an original backup once periodically.

This is good for example when you are running a support forum and getting people mounting screen dumps and the forum will import the image with iminer module and make it operate from the forum from a localised address of the image.

It also uses exif to import the image properties and details as well as having a basic gallary of what has been imported!
